# Simple password checker and generator (Old)
A simple password checker and generator made with python and customTkinter
I made it a few years ago, when I was just starting with python and tkinter to check and generate passwords.

## Functionality
- You are provided with two options: check and generate.
- The checking screen prompts a password and outputs a score based on a number of factors:

- The second option, generate, creates a password and automaticlly checks it:
